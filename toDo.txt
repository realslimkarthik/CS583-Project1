TO-DOs:

2.  function to generate item and calculate actual supports and output dictionary with frequent items (called in each branch of recursion) - Output as an ordereddict
3.  Modification of classes (@property)
4.  function to generate projected database. Args -> oldDB, item (r-PrefixSpan)
5.  In each call of the recursion, remove previous level frequent item (ik) and all items j where |support(j) - support(ik)| > SDC
